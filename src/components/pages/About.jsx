                <h2>Scholarship</h2>
                <p>Scholarship is characterized by a commitment to learning. A student is willing to spend the necessary time to 
                    cultivate their mind in the quest for knowledge. This pillar can only be achieved through diligence and effort. 
                    Scholarship means always doing the best work possible, regardless of impending reward.</p>

                <h2>Service</h2>
                <p>The pillar of service can be reached in a variety of ways. The willingness to work for the benefit of those in need 
                    without compensation or recognition of any kind is a quality that is essential in NHS members. As a service club, 
                    the National Honor Society is highly concerned with giving its all to the school and community at large. </p>

                <h2>Leadership</h2>
                <p>Leaders take the initiative to aid others in a wholesome manner throughout their daily activities. Leaders sacrifice 
                    their personal interests in order to yield to the needs of others. Leaders need wisdom and self-confidence to affect
                     change in all aspects of their lives. They make the conscious choice to be role models for others. Some examples of 
                     leadership can include, but are not limited to, leading group activities in the classroom and in the community, being
                      an officer in a club, being a primary member of the band or choir, or being the captain of a sports team. </p>

                <h2>Character</h2>
                <p>Character is what distinguishes one individual from another. It is the product of constant striving to make the right
                     choices day after day. Students with good character demonstrate respect, responsibility, trustworthiness, fairness,
                     caring, and citizenship in all of their actions. They go beyond what is easy or beneficial to themselves, and do what 
                     is good without expectations.</p>
